# Simplified Red-Black Tree Data Structure Implementation

This project consists of two files, RedBlackTree.java and Main.java. RedBlackTree.java
defines the RedBlackTree class and Main.java contains the main method. The main method accepts
two command line string arguments. The first string is the path of the input file and the second string
is the path of the output file. The input file lists commands that are parsed and executed by the
program, and the result of each commmand is written to the output file. The first line of the input file
must have either the word "Integer" or the word "String" to indicate what data type will be contained
in the red-black tree. Otherwise, an error message will be written to the output file.

Below is a sample input file that lists different commands and the corresponding output file that is generated by
the program:

Input.txt			Output.txt			
	Integer
	Insert:1			True
	Insert:2			True
	Insert:3			True
	Insert:4			True
	PrintTree			55 -68 *45 98
	Contains:4			True
	Insert:5			True
	Insert:6			True
	Insert:7			True
	Insert:4			False
	PrintTree			55 32 *-68 *45 98 *84 *132
	Insert				Error in Line: Insert
	oops				Error in Line: oops
